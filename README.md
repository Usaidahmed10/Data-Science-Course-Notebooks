# Data-Science-Course-Notebooks

Welcome to my **Data-Science-Course-Notebooks** repository! This collection showcases my journey through various data science concepts and techniques, as learned in my course on ethics in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS). These notebooks document my hands-on experience with data loading, manipulation, preprocessing, and methods for addressing ethical concerns in data science. 

This repository is not a tutorial collection but rather a documentation of my learning and experimentation. Each notebook represents an effort to understand key principles, solve problems, and implement solutions related to ethical AI and data science practices.

## Course Focus

This course provides a framework for understanding issues of ethics in AI and DS from a primarily technical perspective and gaining expertise in methods to mitigate adverse impacts. It covers:

- General ethics in AI and DS
- Privacy and fairness implications in data collection, storage, and analytics
- Various definitions of privacy and fairness
- State-of-the-art methods for achieving private and fair DS outcomes
- Real-life case studies with Python notebooks for implementation

## Table of Contents

### 1. Data Handling and Preprocessing
- **Data Loading**: Working with structured and unstructured data sources
- **Data Manipulation**: Using Pandas and NumPy for data transformation
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
- **Data Normalization and Scaling**: Preparing data for machine learning models

### 2. Ethical Considerations in Data Science
- **Bias in Data**: Identifying and mitigating biases in datasets
- **Fairness in Machine Learning**: Approaches to ensure equitable model predictions
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**: Methods such as differential privacy and federated learning
- **Randomization Techniques**: Using randomized methods to reduce biases and ensure fairness

### 3. Machine Learning Applications
- **Regression Models**: Implementing linear and logistic regression for ethical AI
- **Randomization in Model Training**: Techniques to enhance privacy and fairness
- **Evaluating Model Fairness**: Metrics for assessing biased outcomes
